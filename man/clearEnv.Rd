\title{Clean Environment by Removing Selected Objects}
\usage{
clearEnv(x = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector specifying which objects to remove. Can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} (default): Display available objects with their indices
\item \code{numeric}: Remove objects by their index positions
\item \code{character}: Remove objects by their names, or use "all" to remove everything
}}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function is called for its side effects
(removing objects and printing messages).
}
\description{
A utility function to selectively remove objects from the calling environment.
Objects can be removed by name, by index position, or all at once.
}
\details{
When called without arguments, the function displays all available objects
in the calling environment with their corresponding index numbers.

For numeric input, only valid indices (positive integers within the range
of available objects) are processed.

For character input, the special value "all" (case-insensitive) removes
all objects from the environment. Other character values are treated as
object names to be removed.
